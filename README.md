# BaseCoreCMS
This project is a base project repository which is implemented by WebAPI and Asp.net Core 2.1 and is souitable for 
starting a dot net project.

In This Project you will see a customized microsoft identity in a multi layer architecture based on dot net core 2.1 and
a simple Web API for site messages. 

Actually this project is a little part of my new project and probably I'll complete some parts of this project in future.

So It's a sanple and just show my code handwriting for now.
